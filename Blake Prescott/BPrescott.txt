I spent most of my time this summer working in assembly at the Toyota plant in Princeton. I also spent a lot of time playing D&D though,
so that was fun. I also ended up building my dad a PC, which was pretty fun. Towards the end of the summer, me and a few friends drove up
to Michigan. I really recommend visiting Traverse City.
