My summer consisted of summer classes and working here in Muncie.
I didn't get a lot of free time with classes almost everyday for several hours a day. I was able to get a little break and fly to
Arizona to visit family for about a week. If I was home and didn't have a pile of homework to do I would usually play a game on the PC
or the Xbox.
