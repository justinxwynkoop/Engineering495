My summer consisted of summer classes and working here in Muncie.
I didn't get a lot of free time with classes almost everyday for several hours a day. I was able to get a little break and fly to
Arizona to visit family for about a week. If I was home and didn't have a pile of homework to do I would usually play a game on the PC
or the Xbox.

I spent most of my time this summer working in assembly at the Toyota plant in Princeton. I also spent a lot of time playing D&D though, 
so that was fun. I also ended up building my dad a PC, which was pretty fun. Towards the end of the summer, me and a few friends drove up
to Michigan. I really recommend visiting Traverse City.
